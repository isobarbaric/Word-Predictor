### Description for this Project

Word-Predictor aims to implement a robust auto-complete functionality! 

Word-Predictor finds possible word completions that begin with a particular prefix using a prefix tree data structure using the depth-first search algorithm. The scalability of this approach lies in its inherent design - possible words that are predicted come from a database provided to the Trie instance. As a result, this working prototype can easily be applied in a more niche use case as simply changing the database to include the desired words makes the model compatible with necessary features.

Finally, the motivation for this project comes from the frequent association of the Trie data structure with the idea of auto-completion. In a bid to realize this characterization, I decided to create Word-Predictor. :p
 
### Try It Out Yourself!

After having cloned the repository, a JAR (Java ARchive) file is available in the ``dist`` directory of the repository. Simply opening this application like any other will load the GUI associated with this project!

Cheers!
